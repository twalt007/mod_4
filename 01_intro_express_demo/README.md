# Intro Express Server - In Class

In class we will be building a simple express server to serve the pre built front end (client). We will be adding a single endpoint to serve some dummy user data.

This exercise is intended to demonstrate what we will be learning and building towards. You are not expected to understand the majority of the server side code at this point. Within a couple weeks you should be able to refer back to this code and understand the majority of it.
